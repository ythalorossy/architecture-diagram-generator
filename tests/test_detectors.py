"""Per-ecosystem detector baselines.

Each test reads `build_dependency_graph(fixture)` and asserts the project
names AND the dependency edges it observes. These are *characterisation*
tests: they pin the current behaviour of the detectors so that any change
to a detector's output shows up here. Per AC2, multi-module structure must
be asserted, not just membership, so each fixture has at least one
producer and one consumer, and the consumer's edge list is checked.
